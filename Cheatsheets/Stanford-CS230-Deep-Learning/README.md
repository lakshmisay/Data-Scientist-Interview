# Deep Learning cheatsheets for Stanford's CS 230

## Goal
This repository aims at summing up in the same place all the important notions that are covered in Stanford's CS 230 Deep Learning course, and include **cheatsheets detailing everything** about convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, as well as the tips and tricks to have in mind when training a deep learning model.
